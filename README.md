# Writing Some Functions

## Goal
The goal for this program is to write 3 functions in a single program
  * Write a function which finds the greatest common divisor of two non-negative interger values and to return the result
    * GCD, takes two ints as parameters
    
  * Write a function to calculate the absolute value of a number
    * Should take as a parameter a float and return a float
    * Test this function with ints and floats
    
  * Write a function to compute the square root of a number
    * If a negative argument is passed, then a message is displayed and -1.0 should be returned
    * Should use the absoluteValue function as implemented in the above step
